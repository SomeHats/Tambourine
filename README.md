Tambourine
==========

Tambourine is a small library for making little games in the browser. It's made for people who are new to the whole programming thing, and want to try their hand at making games.

Tambourine is made with love by [Drum Roll](http://drumrollhq.com/). Check out [E.A.K](http://eraseallkittens.com/), an open source game that teaches the basics of HTML and CSS.
