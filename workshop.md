# Drum Roll Workshop
## Web Mini-Game Jam
11:00 - 17:00 | lunch: 12:00 - 12:45

### Intro
11:00 - 11:05

* Who are we? Why are we here? Is philosophic, innit.
* Who are Drum Roll? What have we made?
* This is a game jam. A game jam is kind of like a party for game-makers. We get together, and in teams we make a game in one day.
* Our games will be very simple 2D prototypes
* We'll be using the web and something called Tambourine.js - a library that makes it super easy to build really basic games on the web.

### HTML Intro: E.A.K.
11:05 - 11:30

* Use [E.A.K.](http://eraseallkittens.com/) to give everyone a basic feel for HTML. Start by watching the intro video together, then everyone should play the first few levels.
* 25 minutes is probably a little long for this section. Cut off early and spend more time on the next if needed

### Idea Generation
11:30 - 12:00

* Get in to groups of 3 or 4. Number the members of each team.
* Working separately, keeping their ideas secret for now, each member needs to think of one of the following (according to their number) (2 mins)
    1. a rule (e.g. you can't touch the sides)
    2. a victory condition, how you win the game (e.g. find the wisest broccoli)
    3. a theme (e.g. unicorns vs. kittens)
    4. a location (e.g. Mars)
* We are going to supply some extra rules (mainly to steer them towards games that actually can be built in a few hours): 
    - you must be able to play the game in 30 seconds
    - the game must be in 2D
* Now, working with their teams, they need to combine these into coherent game ideas. They need to decide on a basic story, and roughly how the game is going to be played.
* Pass round paper and pens etc. and help them work on their ideas
* The key thing here is to stress that the games are going to be very minimalist and focussed. An MVP, that we can play-test and get validation for

### Lunch
12:00 - 12:45

### HTML and CSS
12:45 - 13:00

* Our game is made up of three things:
  - HTML for content
  - CSS for design
  - JS for behaviour/interaction
* Make artwork for 'Pig Panic' - the farmer and the dodgy pig on make8bitart.com
* Write basic HTML, so we have a static layout for our game ready.

### HTML and CSS: hands on
13:00 - 13:45

* All make art assets and use HTML and CSS to start prototyping a game. Possibly fork from Pig Panic

### JS Part 1:
13:45 - 14:00

* Add JS for jumping in pig panic
* Start with a very simple jumping model, then work up to one that works well

### Programming: hands on
14:00 - 14:45

* Implement the equivalent code from Pig Panic on their games

### JS Part 2:
14:45 - 15:00

* Add pigs and keep score in pig panic

### Programming: hands on
15:00 - 16:30

* A fair bit of support will be needed - see http://tambourine.drumrollhq.com/ for Tambourine docs + tips & tricks
* The teams will likely develop roles - some will be programming, some will be making artwork, etc.
* Spare programmers can work on menus / a website for the game
* This bit isn't really structured at all - make sure everyone is staying on track

### Demos!
16:30 - 16:55

* Split up the teams into groups with one member of each team in the groups.
* The groups should rotate round, trying out all the games

### End!
16:55 - 17:00

* Sum up the day, round everything off, etc.
* YAAYYYYY!!!
